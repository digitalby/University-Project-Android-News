The end goal of the assigment was to create an RSS reader for Android. The project has been created within a week. The following topics had to be covered:

  * **Threads**
  * **Handlers**
  * **Serializable & Parcelable**
  * **AsyncTasks**
  * **Downloading data (including images) from the web**
  * **Working with RSS, XML, HTML data**
  * **WebViews, ProgressBars**

The project is still a work in progress as there are many bugs and inconsistencies. Plus, not all kind of RSS feeds are handled.
